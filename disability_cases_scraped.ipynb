The United States found that DCS failed to communicate effectively with parents and children with hearing disabilities, including by not providing interpreters. DCS also failed to reasonably accommodate the needs of parents with disabilities by, for example, not providing information in a simplified form. Finally, DCS denies parents with disabilities an equal chance to participate in and benefit from DCS programs and services. The United States' letter asks DCS to develop and implement changes to policies and procedures to ensure parents and children with disabilities are not discriminated against in DCS programs and services, train its employees on ADA compliance, and take other measures to redress the discrimination.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-arizonas-department-child-safety-discriminates-against-parents-and\">Press Release</a></p></div>\n",

City of Boston, No. 1:22-cv-11009 (D. Mass.) addressing the correct interpretation of the health services exception in the ADA as applied to a police department.  The health services exception is an exception to the ADA’s exclusion of individuals who currently illegally use drugs, and states that “an individual shall not be denied health services, or services provided in connection with drug rehabilitation, on the basis of the current illegal use of drugs if the individual is otherwise entitled to such services.”  42 U.S.C. § 12210(c). Under Title II of the ADA, the Exception applies to the denial of health services provided by any public entity covered by Title II, including state and local police departments.  The case was brought by the estate of an individual with opioid use disorder, who died of an opioid overdose while in overnight detention after being arrested by the Boston Police Department.  </p></div>\n",

The Department’s investigation revealed that Utah unnecessarily relies on segregated settings—including sheltered workshops and day facilities—to provide these services. As a result, thousands of people with I/DD in Utah spend their days separated from their communities when they could instead work paid community-based jobs and participate in community activities of their choosing. Utah’s failure to provide employment and day services in integrated settings also places other individuals with I/DD in the state, including transition age youth entering adult services, at serious risk of entering these segregated settings. </p>\n",

Plaintiffs allege that Ohio law unlawfully restricts who may assist voters with disabilities with voting absentee in violation of Title II of the ADA, Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act, and other laws. Ohio’s law added a criminal penalty for impermissibly possessing or returning another person’s absentee ballot. The SOI confirms that Section 208 permits voters with disabilities who require assistance to receive that assistance from any person they choose, so long as that person is not an agent of the voter’s employer or union. It also affirms that Title II requires public entities provide equal opportunities to vote absentee and allows voters with disabilities to use an assistor of their choice as a reasonable modification.</p>\n",

Plaintiffs allege that Ohio law unlawfully restricts who may assist voters with disabilities with voting absentee in violation of Title II of the ADA, Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act, and other laws. Ohio’s law added a criminal penalty for impermissibly possessing or returning another person’s absentee ballot. The SOI confirms that Section 208 permits voters with disabilities who require assistance to receive that assistance from any person they choose, so long as that person is not an agent of the voter’s employer or union. It also affirms that Title II requires public entities provide equal opportunities to vote absentee and allows voters with disabilities to use an assistor of their choice as a reasonable modification.\n",

The lawsuit was filed in June 2023 after an investigation that found the county excluded individuals with disabilities from participating in its in-person voting programs by selecting and using vote centers with architectural barriers. The lawsuit also alleged that the county’s curbside voting program was inaccessible. Under the settlement agreement, the county will work with an independent accessibility expert for three years on site selection policies and procedures to ensure that the county selects locations to serve as voting centers that are, or can be made more accessible during the voting period. The county has agreed to work with the expert and the department to implement recommendations. The expert will provide semiannual reports on their findings to the county and the department. \n",

The department’s brief explains that, under the ADA, voters with disabilities must have an equal opportunity to vote by a particular method as do voters without disabilities, and that this equal opportunity requirement is separate from the requirement that public entities make reasonable modifications.\n",

            "Title: Board of Election Commissioners for the City of St Louis, MO\n",
            "Description: On Jan. 12, 2021, the Justice Department reached a settlement under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) with the Board of Election Commissioners for the City of St. Louis to ensure that St. Louis polling places are accessible during elections to individuals with mobility and vision impairments. The department identified architectural barriers at St. Louis polling places, including inaccessible parking, ramps that were too steep, stairs at the only entrance or route to the voting area, and doorways with thresholds that were too high. The department also identified that the St. Louis Board fails to provide accessible curbside voting and auxiliary aids and services, including headphones for some accessible voting machines, and also fails to provide voters with disabilities the same amount of privacy and independence while voting as voters without disabilities. Under the agreement, the St. Louis Board will begin remediating its voting program. To make its selected polling places accessible, the St. Louis Board will employ temporary measures, such as portable ramps, signage, and propped open doors. In addition, the St. Louis Board will train its poll workers and other elections staff on the requirements of the ADA and how to use temporary measures to ensure each polling place is accessible during elections. The St. Louis Board will also survey polling locations for accessibility and maintain the accessibility of each polling place it uses on election days. When selecting future polling places, the agreement requires the St. Louis Board to select locations that will be accessible during elections.\n",
            "On October 3, 2023, the Department and St. Louis Board agreed to modify and extend the agreement. The St. Louis Board will hire an expert for conducting or reviewing accessibility surveys, identifying appropriate temporary measures, and training staff. The agreement expires on July 11, 2025.\n",

            "Description: On August 18, 2022, the Justice Department filed a Statement of Interest in Carey, et al. v. Wisconsin Election Commission, et al., Case No. 3:22-cv-0402 clarifying the obligation to provide assistance to voters with disabilities under Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act and Title II of the ADA.  In their motion for preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs argue that Wisconsin law violates Section 208 by barring the assistance they need to return their absentee ballots to be counted and that the ADA requires Wisconsin to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.\n",

Plaintiffs allege that Ohio law unlawfully restricts who may assist voters with disabilities with voting absentee in violation of Title II of the ADA, Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act, and other laws. Ohio’s law added a criminal penalty for impermissibly possessing or returning another person’s absentee ballot. The SOI confirms that Section 208 permits voters with disabilities who require assistance to receive that assistance from any person they choose, so long as that person is not an agent of the voter’s employer or union. It also affirms that Title II requires public entities provide equal opportunities to vote absentee and allows voters with disabilities to use an assistor of their choice as a reasonable modification.\n",

The lawsuit was filed in June 2023 after an investigation that found the county excluded individuals with disabilities from participating in its in-person voting programs by selecting and using vote centers with architectural barriers. The lawsuit also alleged that the county’s curbside voting program was inaccessible. Under the settlement agreement, the county will work with an independent accessibility expert for three years on site selection policies and procedures to ensure that the county selects locations to serve as voting centers that are, or can be made more accessible during the voting period. The county has agreed to work with the expert and the department to implement recommendations. The expert will provide semiannual reports on their findings to the county and the department. \n",

The department’s brief explains that, under the ADA, voters with disabilities must have an equal opportunity to vote by a particular method as do voters without disabilities, and that this equal opportunity requirement is separate from the requirement that public entities make reasonable modifications.\n",

The department identified architectural barriers at St. Louis polling places, including inaccessible parking, ramps that were too steep, stairs at the only entrance or route to the voting area, and doorways with thresholds that were too high. The department also identified that the St. Louis Board fails to provide accessible curbside voting and auxiliary aids and services, including headphones for some accessible voting machines, and also fails to provide voters with disabilities the same amount of privacy and independence while voting as voters without disabilities. Under the agreement, the St. Louis Board will begin remediating its voting program. To make its selected polling places accessible, the St. Louis Board will employ temporary measures, such as portable ramps, signage, and propped open doors. In addition, the St. Louis Board will train its poll workers and other elections staff on the requirements of the ADA and how to use temporary measures to ensure each polling place is accessible during elections. The St. Louis Board will also survey polling locations for accessibility and maintain the accessibility of each polling place it uses on election days. When selecting future polling places, the agreement requires the St. Louis Board to select locations that will be accessible during elections.\n",
